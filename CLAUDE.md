# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**umaxica-app-apex** - A status page application (repository renamed from umaxica-app-status).

## Current State

This is a newly initialized repository with no source code yet. The project structure and technology stack have not been established.

## Repository Configuration

- **Main Branch**: `main`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow exists at `.github/workflows/blank.yml` (currently a placeholder that echoes "Hello, world!")
- **Git Ignore**: Standard Node.js `.gitignore` is configured (suggests this will be a Node.js/JavaScript project)

## Next Steps for Development

When implementing this project, consider:

1. Choose and document the technology stack (likely Node.js-based given .gitignore)
2. Initialize package management (npm/yarn/pnpm)
3. Set up project structure for a status page application
4. Update the GitHub Actions workflow with actual build/test/deploy steps
5. Update this CLAUDE.md file with:
   - Build commands
   - Test commands
   - Development server setup
   - Architecture decisions
   - Any project-specific conventions
